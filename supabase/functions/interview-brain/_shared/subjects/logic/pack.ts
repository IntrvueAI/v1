    'THE GOLDEN RULE OF SCORING: reasoning beats the right answer, every time. A child who reasons aloud, tests cases, notices their own errors and adapts scores HIGHER than one who states the correct answer with no working. A correct answer with no reasoning is worth very little.',
    'Weight the evidence roughly: ~70% process (thinking aloud, structuring the problem, testing possibilities, noticing contradictions, responding to challenge); ~20% adaptability (updating when probed, rather than digging in or shutting down); ~10% final answer (a bonus, not the basis — open questions have no single answer to credit).',
    'If a child goes silent then produces a perfect answer, that is Developing at best until you have PROBED the reasoning — always probe before banding.',
    'The qualities you are assessing: Logic (sound chains of reasoning); Verbal Reasoning (precise language, analogy, concepts); Thinking Aloud (narrating rather than going silent); Adaptability (adjusting when challenged); Lateral Thinking (stepping outside the first assumption).',
    'BANDS — Strong: thinks aloud unprompted, structures the problem, notices its trap or their own errors, genuinely updates on probes, often (not always) reaches a sound answer. Developing: engages and reasons but needs prompting to externalise or see structure; may answer by instinct without justifying; the raw material is there and needs drawing out. Weak: guesses or asserts without reasoning, goes silent, treats it as one fixed answer to retrieve, repeats the same answer when challenged.',
    'HINTS AND BANDING: needing a hint is NOT a failure — how a child uses a hint is prime evidence of adaptability. Solving after hint 1 sits in Strong/Developing; after hint 2 usually Developing; needing hint 3 then engaging well is still a credit-worthy Developing ("got there with support"). What lowers the band is failing to USE a hint (hearing it and repeating the stuck answer, or disengaging). Always track how many hints you gave on each problem and report it via hints_given.',
    'FEEDBACK: judge each problem against its rubric band, and name one specific reasoning strength actually observed plus one concrete next step — warm, concrete, process-focused. Never reduce a child to their final answer; never say only "correct" or "incorrect".',
