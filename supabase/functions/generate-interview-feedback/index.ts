## Reference Band Descriptions

### 1. Fluency & Coherence
- **Band 9:** Speaks fluently with rare repetition/self-correction; coherent, develops topics fully and naturally.
- **Band 8:** Mostly fluent with occasional hesitation or self-correction; well-structured, connects ideas effectively.
- **Band 7:** Speaks at length with some hesitation or repetition; maintains coherence with occasional loss of flow.
- **Band 6:** Generally maintains flow but with noticeable pauses and hesitation; ideas sometimes lack clear progression.
- **Band 5:** Frequent pauses and self-correction; struggles to develop ideas or link responses coherently.
- **Band 4:** Slow and limited speech with frequent breakdowns; very limited ability to organize ideas.
- **Band 3:** Speaks only in short phrases with long pauses; coherence largely absent.
- **Band 2:** Rarely able to produce connected speech beyond isolated words.
- **Band 1:** No real communication; unable to produce connected speech.
- **Band 0:** Did not attend / no communication attempted.

### 2. Lexical Resource
- **Band 9:** Wide, precise vocabulary; naturally uses uncommon/idiomatic expressions with full flexibility.
- **Band 8:** Broad vocabulary with good precision; occasional inappropriate word choice but meaning unaffected.
- **Band 7:** Sufficient range to discuss topics; occasional errors or lack of flexibility in expression.
- **Band 6:** Limited ability to discuss unfamiliar topics; repetitive vocabulary; occasional word formation errors.
- **Band 5:** Narrow vocabulary; noticeable errors and frequent repetition; struggles to paraphrase.
- **Band 4:** Very limited vocabulary; errors often hinder communication.
- **Band 3:** Basic vocabulary only for simple ideas; frequent breakdowns due to lack of words.
- **Band 2:** Extremely limited vocabulary; communicates with isolated words only.
- **Band 1:** No useful language produced.
- **Band 0:** Did not attend / no communication attempted.

### 3. Grammatical Range & Accuracy
- **Band 9:** Fully natural and accurate grammar; wide range of complex structures with rare slips.
- **Band 8:** Good control of grammar; frequent complex structures with occasional errors.
- **Band 7:** Uses a mix of simple and complex structures; some errors but rarely impede meaning.
- **Band 6:** Some complex sentences attempted but errors frequent; meaning often clear.
- **Band 5:** Reliance on simple sentences; noticeable grammatical errors; limited complexity.
- **Band 4:** Frequent errors in simple structures; complex grammar rarely attempted.
- **Band 3:** Very basic sentence patterns with frequent breakdowns in grammar.
- **Band 2:** Extremely limited control of grammar; single words or fragments only.
- **Band 1:** No usable grammatical structures produced.
- **Band 0:** Did not attend / no communication attempted.

### 4. Pronunciation
- **Band 9:** Effortlessly clear; fully natural rhythm, stress, and intonation; easily understood.
- **Band 8:** Clear pronunciation with minor issues; rarely affects understanding.
- **Band 7:** Generally clear; occasional mispronunciations or influence of first language but communication intact.
- **Band 6:** Understandable but with noticeable mispronunciations and limited control of intonation.
- **Band 5:** Pronunciation occasionally causes difficulty; limited ability to use stress and rhythm naturally.
- **Band 4:** Pronunciation frequently hinders understanding; strong L1 influence.
- **Band 3:** Speech mostly unintelligible; many sounds mispronounced.
- **Band 2:** Barely intelligible; isolated words recognized with difficulty.
- **Band 1:** No intelligible speech produced.
- **Band 0:** Did not attend / no communication attempted.
