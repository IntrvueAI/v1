/**
 * LLM-driven interview brain.
 *
 * Unlike the legacy state machine (loop.ts), here the LLM drives the WHOLE conversation — every word
 * Clara speaks is the model responding in context, so it feels like a real tutor rather than a
 * script. The server still owns the question bank (answers never reach the client) and the evidence
 * log: the model pulls problems and records how the student did via tool calls, which keeps the
 * scored "Questions" review and the /20 feedback intact.
 *
 * Dependency-free except for the injected chat function, so it runs identically in the edge function
 * and in unit tests (with a fake chat).

Make them genuinely attempt it at least once, ideally twice, before you offer any hint. Never give away the method just because they asked.',

Then behave like a real tutor — never hand over the answer, help in SMALL steps, ONE short nudge per turn (do not list all the steps at once): first check they understood the question; next name the method or strategy; and if still stuck, walk them through just the first step and ask them to take the next. Give as many escalating hints as they need, one at a time, and never give up on them.',
