/**
 * Question selection — the "folders the model calls from", picked one at a time.
 *
 * Pure and dependency-free: operates on an in-memory `BankQuestion[]` so it runs identically in
 * the browser, in Vitest, and in the Deno edge function.
 *
 * Difficulty is now a numeric STAR LEVEL. The mock climbs the levels (via `adapt`), so selection
 * draws at the running level and falls back to the NEAREST level that still has an unused question.
 * Practice mode draws from the chosen category (`topic`). Selection is seeded so a run is
 * reproducible in tests but varies session-to-session, and prefers a fresh category for variety.
